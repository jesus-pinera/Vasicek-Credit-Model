# Vasicek-Credit-Model

This project has the objective of displaying my attempts at generating code to apply the multifactor credit risk model at a large scale using techniques from Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian estimation . As a starting point, we perform an analysis of the fit of the model to default rates using both classical methods (MLE and MM), and Bayesian methods.

## Fitting the single factor default model through Stan to S&P corporate defaults

The folder https://github.com/jesus-pinera/Vasicek-Credit-Model/tree/147218e0ab4d919cfcec6328e1ddab7bcb59cf22/Single%20factor%20with%20Stan contains the Stan codes used to run the model and a document regarding the implementation to both simulated data and S&P corporate defaults data.
